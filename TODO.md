# Slippi melee timestamper
Press a hotkey on the keyboard to save a timestamp of where in a melee game you currently are.  
this would allow you to go back and find cool combos or moments you've manually saved  


### What we already have:
- auto music player
- listening for new melee
- - access to frame data each frame



### Add these:
- [x] listen for an input to make bookmark (button in html)
- - [x] get the current frame of melee game
- - [x] write bookmark (and frame data) to text file?
- - [x] come up with output format
- - - timestamps.txt => 22222,path/path/game.slp
- [x] listen for POST/GET requests on server
- [x] look into processing text files for Slippi Launcher (launch replay at that timestamp)
- [ ] make project clippi-valid ouptut files?
- [x] move button to AHK
- - [ ] AHK bound to gamecube?? (dpad down)
- [ ] get it to start a replay (comown üê°)
