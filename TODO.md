# Slippi melee timestamper
Press a hotkey on the keyboard to save a timestamp of where in a melee game you currently are.  
this would allow you to go back and find cool combos or moments you've manually saved  


### What we already have:
- auto music player
- listening for new melee
- - access to frame data each frame



### Add these:
- [x] listen for an input to make bookmark (button in html)
- - [ ] get the current frame of melee game
- - [ ] write bookmark (and frame data) to text file?
- [ ] look into processing text files for Slippi Launcher (launch replay at that timestamp)
- [ ] move button to AHK
- - [ ] AHK bound to gamecube?? (dpad down)
